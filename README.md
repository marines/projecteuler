My solutions of Project Euler problems.

## Comments to solutions

### Problem 31

Nasty bruteforce. Probably could have been solved on a piece of paper but this one executed in a couple of minutes so I didn't care much. I'm aware that begginings of ranges could have been adjusted so that obvious sums over 200 are eliminated.

### Problem 46

Well, that was quick. Didn't expect the result to be so small number hence high iterations number. Works quite quick.
